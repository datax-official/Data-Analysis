# Astronomical Data (Tabular) - Visualizations

In this notebook, we will explore the fascinating world of astronomical data through the lens of data visualization. Our primary objectives are:

## Objectives:

1. **Understanding Astronomical Tabular Data**:
   - Gain insights into the structure and content of astronomical datasets.
   - Learn how to interpret various features and columns within the data, such as celestial object types, distances, and magnitudes.

2. **Creating Effective Visualizations**:
   - Use Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visualizations that effectively represent the data.
   - Explore different types of plots, including scatter plots, histograms, heatmaps, and more, tailored to the unique characteristics of astronomical data.

3. **Choosing the Right Visualization**:
   - Understand the rationale behind selecting specific visualizations for different types of data.
   - Learn how to choose the most appropriate plot based on the task at hand, whether it's analyzing distribution, identifying correlations, or exploring patterns.

## Important Note:

- **Re-running Code Cells**: Whenever we modify the style or appearance of the plots, you may need to re-run the code cells to see the changes reflected in the output. This ensures that the visualizations are up-to-date and accurately represent the data.

By the end of this notebook, you'll have a deeper understanding of how to work with astronomical data and create visualizations that reveal the underlying patterns and insights in the dataset. This knowledge is essential for anyone looking to delve into the field of astronomy and data science.
